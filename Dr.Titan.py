                        Sometimes, a runny nose is a symptom of an allergic reaction. If this symptom is due to an allergy and not a cold, antihistamines may help.
                        Antihistamines : Brompheniramine (Dimetane)
                                         Cetirizine (Zyrtec)
                                         Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton)
                                         Clemastine (Tavist)
                        Decongestants can help relieve a stuffy nose.
                        Decongestants : Afrin, Dristan, Vicks Sinex (oxymetazoline)
                                        Sudafed PE, Suphedrin PE (phenylephrine)
                                        Silfedrine, Sudafed, Suphedrin (pseudoephedrine)
                        Topical nasal sprays offer quick relief but may cause rebound congestion with overuse. 
                        People should restrict using decongestants to a maximum of 3 consecutive days.

                    2.Hydration: It’s very important children with a cold get plenty of fluids. Colds can dehydrate them quickly. Make sure they’re drinking regularly. Water is great. Warm drinks like tea can pull double duty as a sore throat soother.
                    3.Food: Kids with a cold may not feel as hungry as usual, so look for ways to give them calories and fluids. Smoothies and soups are two great options.
                    4.Salt gargles: They aren’t the most pleasant experience, but gargling with warm, salty water can make sore throats feel better. Saline nasal sprays can also help clear nasal congestion.

                    4.Pain medications. Over-the-counter pain medications can reduce pain and inflammation. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin®, Advil®) and naproxen (Aleve®) can be used, or take acetaminophen (Tylenol®) if you can’t take NSAIDs.

                    2.Vanilla extract. The alcohol in vanilla extract numbs pain temporarily and its antioxidants help the area heal. Use your fingertips or cotton ball to apply the extract to the tooth and gum a few times a day.
                    3.Peppermint tea. Peppermint’s soothing properties can be applied to the painful area with a cooled down peppermint tea bag. Hold this warm tea bag against the tooth and gum.
                    4.Garlic. Make a paste of a crushed garlic clove and apply to the affected area. Garlic can kill bacteria (it contains the antimicrobial allicin) and relieve pain.''')
